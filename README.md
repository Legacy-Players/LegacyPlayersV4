# Legacy Players: A Community-Driven World of Warcraft Data Platform

Welcome to Legacy Players, the collaborative project tailored for programmers within the World of Warcraft community. Initiated in 2022 by the Turtle WoW Team, Legacy Players is a platform designed to facilitate the sharing and analysis of raid logs, PvP logs, and armory data across various expansion packs. As developers, you play a crucial role in preserving the rich gaming history and performance insights.

## What is Legacy Players?

Legacy Players, reinvigorated in 2022 by the Turtle WoW Team, serves as a dedicated space for programmers interested in World of Warcraft private servers. The primary objective is to create a unified platform that allows for the seamless sharing of data and insights into raid performance across different expansions.

## How does it work?

### Uploading Raid Data
To contribute, programmers can utilize the provided main and helper addons, available for Vanilla, TBC, and WoTLK. Enabling the helper addon during raids significantly improves data accuracy. Ensure the removal of the ./Logs/WoWCombatLog.txt file before entering the raid for optimal results.

### Creating an Account
Programmers can create an account without the need for email confirmation. Subsequently, they can upload a ZIP archive of the ./Logs/CombatLog.txt file to [Legacy Players Upload](https://legacyplayers.com/contribute/upload), selecting the corresponding realm. The PvE overview is updated within a minute, providing valuable insights. Track upload history conveniently in your account settings.

## Can I add my own private server?

Certainly! Legacy Players encourages programmers to expand the platform's reach. To add your server, reach out to Niralthas via Legacy Players's official Discord channel (#legacy-players). Utilize the provided exporter for seamless integration, allowing your server to interact with LegacyPlayer's API and automate the logging process for your players.
